1. Even the modified content contains other languages, the commit message should be written in English.

2. Separate each action into a separate sentence.

3. Append empty lines between each sentence.

4. Select appropriate emoji from the [Appendix](#appendix-mapping-of-emoji-to-their-intended-meanings) below and append into the beginnings of each sentence.
